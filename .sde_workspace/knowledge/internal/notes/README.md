# Notes

Work notes in different stages of refinement.

## Structure

- **raw/**: Raw notes, quick capture
- **summary/**: Consolidated and refined notes

## Flow

1. Capture ideas quickly in `raw/`
2. Refine and organize in `summary/`
3. Promote to other areas when mature
4. Maintain linking between related notes
