# External Knowledge

Knowledge from sources external to the organization.

## Subdirectories

- **sources/**: Original and processed materials
- **standards/**: Market norms and standards
- **vendor-docs/**: Vendor documentation
- **research/**: Research, whitepapers and benchmarks
- **transcripts/**: Event and external meeting transcriptions

## Principles

- Keep original sources in `sources/raw/` as immutable
- Process and normalize content in `sources/processed/`
- Organize by vendor or source when applicable
