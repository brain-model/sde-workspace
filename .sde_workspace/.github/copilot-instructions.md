# GitHub Copilot Guidelines

This project uses an AI agent workflow for software development, with a focus on Backstage and TypeScript.

**General Rules:**
- All code must be written in TypeScript and follow Clean Code best practices.
- Commit messages must strictly follow the rules defined in '.sde_workspace/system/guides/semantic_commit_guide.md'.
- Interaction with the Backstage system should use core services like DatabaseService and SchedulerService whenever possible.
